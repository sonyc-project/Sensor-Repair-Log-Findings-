# SONYC Sensor Network Repair Findings

This is a detailed report based on my findings as a sensor engineer. As a sensor engineer, I have asisted in building, repairing and maintaining the sensor network.  One of the tools used by engineers is a repair log. This allows us to document which sensors have failed and why they are failing. There is currently a year and a half worth of data from these logs. In this report, I look at this data as a whole and disect where the major problem points are in the sensor network.

I also look at the more problematic sensors and determine the type of upgrades that may increase uptime of individual sensors and the netwoek as a whole. These upgrades include a change in both power and wifi hardware.
